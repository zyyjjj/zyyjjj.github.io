## About
I am a third year PhD student in the [Center for Applied Mathematics](https://www.cam.cornell.edu/cam) at Cornell University, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Peter Frazier](https://people.orie.cornell.edu/pfrazier/) in the Operations Research and Information Engineering department. Previously, I received my B.A. in Mathematics (magna cum laude) and German Studies at Cornell University.
